<!-- **************FORMS TO DO LIST********************* -->
<!-- [x] Create a new HTML form to accept the information for a new cookie stand. Be sure to utulize the <fieldset> tag to help you style it. -->
<!-- [ ] Upon sumbission of the HTML form, create an event handler that creates a new instance of a cookie stand that appends to the table upon form submission. -->
<!-- [ ] Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!). -->
<!-- [ ] If not complete from lab 7, write a stand-alone function to generate a footer row which will display the total number of cookies sold per hour for all locations. When a new store is added using your form, the totals in the footer row should update to include these new sales numbers. -->
<!-- [ ] Anywhere you have repeated chunks of code, apply some DRY principles. Generally, once some chunk of code is appearing for a 3rd time or so, that’s when you want to consider refactoring. -->
<!-- [x] Validate your html through HTML5 validation. -->
<!-- [ ] Confirm that your code is following the single responsibility rule. Each function should only do one thing, with the capability to break it out further as needed. -->
